2.3.7
enable -> enter privileged mode(#)
clock set hh:mm:ss dd mmm yyyy -> sets the clock to the specified date
			       -> execute in privileged mode (#)
show clock -> shows the current clock

2.3.8
show version -> show the current OS version in the switch

2.5.5
show running-config -> shows the current switch's configuration
		    -> alternative: show run
configure terminarl -> enter (config)# mode
hostname <<name>> -> changes the devices name to <<name>>
line console 0 -> enter (config-line)# mode
	       -> execute in config mode ((cofig)#)
password <<password>> -> sets <<password>> as the password that'll be asked when entering the devices console

login -> makes the device ask for a password to enter vty
      -> execute in command line mode (config-line)#
enable password <<password>> -> makes device ask for password to enter privileged execution mode
			     -> run in (config)# mode
enable secret <<password>> -> samething as enable password <<password>> but more secure 
			   -> password for privileged mode
service password-encryption -> encrypts all currently set passwords
banner motd "<<message>>" -> sets a message to appear when user connects to vty
copy running-config startup-config -> saves the current running configuration as the startup configuration
				   -> run in privileged mode
2.7.6
interface vlan x -> goes int (config-if)# mode 
		 -> x being the number of the interface 

ip address <<ip address>> <<sub network mask>> -> sets the ip address & subnetwork mask
no shutdown -> set configured interfaces to up (?)

show ip interface brief -> shows the ip of all interfaces

2.8.1
2.8.2
ping <<ip address>> -> ping the given ip address
		    -> it's common for the first ping ever to a new ip address to time out but the second normally gets a reply
		    -> it's important to check connectivity in both directions, if it works in one direction but not the other, the issue is probably the firewall

2.9.1
2.9.2
3.5.5
(how to use simulation mode)
4.6.5
4.7.1
tracert <<site web>> -> gives the intermediary ip address to the given website
		     -> use on computer not CISCO device
9.1.3
arp -d -> delete arp table cache on computer
       -> use on computer not CISCO device
arp -a -> print the arp table cache on computer
       -> use on computer not CISCO device
9.3.4
show ipv6 neighbours -> gives the ipv6 values of all the peripherics in the current network

CASE study 
login block-for <<time in seconds to be blocked for>> attempts <<num attempts until block>> within <<timeframe to count attempts in seconds>>
	- execute in config mode
security passwords <<attribute>> <<value>>
	- ex: min-length
no exec-timeout -> disables timeout on connections
exec-timeout <<time>> <<>> -> enables time out on connections
logging synchronous
description <<text>> -> gives a interface a description
		     -> use in interface configuration mode
username <<>> password <<>> -> configure username
			    -> config t mode
ip domain-name <<>> -> priviledged mode
crypto key generate rsa general-keys modulus 1024 -> config t mode
			-> use 1024
ip ssh version 2 -> enables ssh

skill assessment ptsa
no ip domain lookup -> disable DNS lookup
		    -> config t mode
ipv6 unicast-routing
ipv6 address <<address>> -> use / notation (ex: A:0:3::/64)
ipv6 address <<address>> link-local

int range f0/1-4, f0/7-24 -> configure multiple interfaces at the same time
shutdown -> turns the interface off
	 -> execute in interface config mode 

vtp mode <<mode>>
	- ex: transparent
spanning-tree mode <<>>
		   - rapid-pvst
spanning-tree portfast <<>>
		      - default
spanning-tree vlan <<ports>> priority <<>> 

vlan <<>>
name <<str>> -> sets vlan name

configure ssh
line vty 0 <<>>
login local 
transport input ssh
exit

switchport <<>> encapsulation dot1q
configure unused switch 
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan <<>>
shutdown
